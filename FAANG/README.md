# Project Overview

In this project, we'll do analysis on FAANG tech stocks as well as build a Monte Carlo Simulation to forecast stock prices into the future.  

**Project Steps**

* Used an API to pull data into a pandas dataframe.  
* Created visualisations to extend analysis on the portfolio selected.
* Implemented Monte Carlo Simulation on stock price
* Came to conclusions about future stock price using forecasted stock price.

## Code

You can find the code for this project [here](https://github.com/JoshuaOD/Projects/tree/main/FAANG).

File overview:

* `Predict Stocks using Monte Carlo Simulation.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that contains the project front to back.
